  title: Baluarte Watch Tower
  description: Baluarte stands in disarray, vertically cut in two because of eroded
    base and foundation, its two halves stand through concrete post supports on its
    sides. Like an old wounded soldier, it still stands in the pebble beaches of
    Luna, watching its industrious stone pickers finding a way for survival amidst
    the scorching hot sun. It was recently rehabilitated by the LGU with assistance
    from the National Historic Institute. It now features a Love Lock gate inspired
    by a famous tourist spot in N Seoul Korea where lovers can make a pact by putting
    a lock in the gate and throwing the keys.
  address: 'Luna, La Union '
