  title: Urbiztondo Surf Area
  description: Urbiztondo is where the most famous surfing beach is located. Most
    surfing gigs and competitions happen here so it is not a surprise that it became
    the center of hotels and food hubs. It also became popular not only for surfer
    enthusiasts but also for those who want to just chill and party. The main Urbiztondo
    beach where most of the events happen runs almost 1 km long and has brown to
    black sand with rocky to coarse texture.
  address: San Juan, La Union
